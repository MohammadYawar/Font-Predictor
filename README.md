# Font-Predictor
The task is to calssify different fonts. The data was cleaned and then KNN was applied for classification  for different values of the hyperparameter. 
In order to improve the accuracy tweighted KNN was used with the best value of hyperparameter obtained from previous best model. The new solution improved accuracy from ~78% to ~90%
